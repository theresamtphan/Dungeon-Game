# Dungeon-Game
"You've woken up in a dark dungeon... distraught, hungry, and confused...                     
You notice a backpack next to you. You check the contents and find a wooden sword and a measely pan lid.   
You think to yourself... 'Is this a prank? What am I doing here?'                           
Stomach rumbling, the only thing you know for certain is that you need to get out before you starve to death"

This program is a dungeon game that has the player move through the spaces of the dungeon and interact with some of the spaces to get items and accomplish goals.
The limiting factor of this game is the hunger level of the player. If the player's hunger level gets to zero, the player will starve and die.
